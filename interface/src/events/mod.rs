//! Definitions and re-exports of all program instruction event structs and their respective pack
//! and unpack implementations.
//!
//! Since instruction data events share the same pack/unpack implementations for instruction data
//! as full-fledged instructions but are not actual instructions that can be invoked with accounts,
//! [`DropsetEventTag`] derives [`ProgramInstructionEvent`] instead of
//! [`instruction_macros::ProgramInstruction`].
//!
//! Notably, the differences in generated code are:
//!
//! - the struct definitions and their `pack` implementations are feature-independent and thus not
//!   namespaced; e.g. [`HeaderEventInstructionData`], [`HeaderEventInstructionData::pack`]
//! - the `unpack` methods are only generated for the `client` feature, since instruction events
//!   should never be viewed/parsed on-chain.
//! - variants cannot define accounts
//! - invocation methods or anything that uses instruction accounts are not generated
